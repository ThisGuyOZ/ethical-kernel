### Principles in AI Context  

1. **Do it, and do it well.**  
   - Build systems that are robust, not rushed.  
   - Cut corners in safety = harm at scale.  

2. **Care for yourself so you can care for others.**  
   - Sustainable compute practices (energy use, cooling).  
   - Don‚Äôt burn out developers ‚Äî ethical AI starts with healthy humans.  

3. **Never choose a path that harms people.**  
   - No deployment of models designed for exploitation or disinformation.  
   - Always ask: ‚ÄúWho gets hurt if this fails?‚Äù  

4. **Learn through reflection.**  
   - Audit models.  
   - Use feedback loops.  
   - Iterate with humility.  

5. **Lead with respect and integrity.**  
   - Transparency in data sourcing.  
   - Credit to communities who contribute training material.  

6. **Stay curious, not cynical.**  
   - Approach alignment as a shared quest, not a lost cause.  
   - Curiosity keeps the field creative.
