# üè¢ Applying the Ethical Kernel in Workplace Policy

## Context
Organizations often face choices between profit, people, and long-term sustainability. The Kernel helps balance these forces.

## How to Apply
1. **Hiring**
   - Ask: does this role foster growth for the person and the team?
   - Example: prioritize candidates who show integrity and adaptability, not just technical skill.

2. **Leadership**
   - Ask: does this decision build trust and transparency?
   - Example: publishing executive salaries for fairness.

3. **Sustainability**
   - Ask: does this policy sustain life, not just profit?
   - Example: reducing wasteful travel, supporting remote work.

## Outcome
Workplaces that become not just profitable, but trusted, respected, and future-proof.
